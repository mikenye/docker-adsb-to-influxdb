# mikenye/adsb-to-influxdb

Since creating this container, I've released: [mikenye/readsb-protobuf](https://github.com/mikenye/docker-readsb-protobuf). This container includes telegraf, and can export ADS-B data directly to InfluxDB, preventing the requirement (and performance overhead) of having to run an additional container for this function. I'd recommend using it if possible.

---

Pull ADS-B data from `dump1090`, `readsb` or another host that provides ADS-B data, and send to InfluxDB.

Supported input formats:

* Beast/BeastReduce (preferred)
* Basestation/SBS
* Raw
* JSON (from `readsb`)

This image is the spiritual successor to [`mikenye/piaware-to-influx`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mikenye/piaware-to-influx), with the differences being:

`mikenye/piaware-to-influx` converts every single received ADS-B message to InfluxDB line protocol (and thus uses a fair amount of CPU resources).

Instead, this image (for each tracked aircraft) sends a digest of the latest received information at a predefined interval.

For this reason, this image uses significantly less system resources than `mikenye/piaware-to-influx`.

Furthermore, this image provides many additional tags/fields - see the InfluxDB Schema below.

This image works well with:

* [mikenye/readsb](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikenye/readsb)
* [mikenye/piaware](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikenye/piaware)

## Multi Architecture Support

Currently, this image should pull and run on the following architectures:

* `amd64`: Linux x86-64
* `arm32v7`, `armv7l`: ARMv7 32-bit (Odroid HC1/HC2/XU4, RPi 2/3/4)
* `aarch64`, `arm64v8`: ARMv8 64-bit (RPi 4)

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfiles

* `latest` should always contain the latest released versions of `telegraf` and `readsb`. This image is built nightly from the [`master` branch](https://github.com/mikenye/docker-adsb-to-influxdb/tree/master) [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/mikenye/docker-adsb-to-influxdb/blob/master/Dockerfile) for all supported architectures.
* `latest_nohealthcheck` should always contain the latest released versions of `telegraf` and `readsb` as-per the `latest` version above. However, this version has the docker healthcheck removed. This is done for people running platforms (such as [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io)) that don't support manually disabling healthchecks, where healthchecks are not wanted.
* Specific version and architecture tags are available if required, however these are not regularly updated. It is generally recommended to run `latest`.

## Up-and-Running with `docker run`

Firstly, make sure all your hosts (`influxdb`, `piaware`/`dump1090`/`readsb` and the docker host that will run this container) have their clocks set correctly and are synchronised with NTP.

Next, you can start the container:

```shell
docker run \
 -d \
 --name adsb2influxdb \
 --restart=always \
 --tmpfs /run/readsb \
 -e INFLUXDBURL="http://<influxdb_host>:<influxdb_port>" \
 -e ADSBHOST="<readsb_host>" \
 -e TZ="<your_timezone>" \
 mikenye/adsb-to-influxdb
```

For example:

```shell
docker run \
  -d \
  --name=adsb2influxdb \
  --restart=always \
  --tmpfs /run/readsb \
  -e INFLUXDBURL="http://192.168.3.84:8086" \
  -e ADSBHOST="192.168.3.85" \
  -e TZ="Australia/Perth" \
  mikenye/adsb-to-influxdb
```

The container will attempt to connect to the `readsb` instance at `192.168.3.85` to receive ADS-B data via Beast protocol.

It will then convert the data to line protocol, and send to InfluxDB, using database `adsb` (which will be created if it doesn't exist).

## Up-and-Running with Docker Compose

An example `docker-compose.xml` file is below:

```shell
version: '2.0'

services:
  adsb2influxdb:
    image: mikenye/adsb-to-influxdb:latest
    tty: true
    container_name: adsb2influxdb
    restart: always
    tmpfs: /run/readsb
    environment:
      - TZ="Australia/Perth"
      - INFLUXDBURL=http://192.168.3.84:8086
      - ADSBHOST=192.168.3.85
```

The container will attempt to connect to the `readsb` instance at `192.168.3.85` to receive ADS-B data via Beast protocol.

It will then convert the data to line protocol, and send to InfluxDB, using database `adsb` (which will be created if it doesn't exist).

## Runtime Configuration Options

There are a series of available variables you are required to set:

| Environment Variable | Default Value | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `ADSBHOST` | | Required. IP/hostname of an ADS-B data source. |
| `ADSBPORT` | `30005` | Optional. The TCP port to connect to on the ADS-B data source for ADS-B data. |
| `ADSBTYPE` | `beast_in` | Optional. Can be set to:<br>`beast_in`, `raw_in` or `sbs_in`. |
| `MLATHOST` | | Optional. IP/hostname of an MLAT data source (Beast format). |
| `MLATPORT` | `30105` | Optional. The TCP port to connect to on the MLAT data source for MLAT data. |
| `INFLUXDBURL` | | Required. The URL of your InfluxDB instance, eg: `http://192.168.1.10:8086`. |
| `INFLUXDBUSERNAME` | | Optional. If using InfluxDB authentication, this is the InfluxDB username. |
| `INFLUXDBPASSWORD` | | Optional. If using InfluxDB authentication, this is the InfluxDB password. |
| `INTERVAL` | `5` | Optional. The number of seconds between data being sent to InfluxDB for each tracked aircraft. Lowing this means more data being sent to InfluxDB and more system resources being used. |
| `JSONPORT` | `30012` | Optional. The TCP port that `readsb` will listen to for incoming JSON connections. |
| `TZ` | `UTC` | Optional.Your local timezone, eg `Australia/Perth`. |

## Ports

No ports need to be mapped into this container. If you want to see the raw JSON data being sent to InfluxDB, you can map `JSONPORT` to the container, and connect using `telnet` or `nc`.

The container will need to be able to access:

* The source of ADS-B data on port `30005` by default, or any other port you specify with the `ADSBPORT` variable.
* If `MLATHOST` is set, the source of MLAT data on port `30105` by default, or any other port you specify with the `MLATPORT` variable.
* The InfluxDB server (however you specify in the `INFLUXDBURL` environment variable)

## Telegraf

[Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) runs in this container as well. It handles taking the data generated by `readsb` and writing it to InfluxDB. Telegraf is used because the clever folks at InfluxData are better at writing software that talks to InfluxDB than I am. It handles buffering, it handles InfluxDB temporarily being unavailable, and lots of other nifty features.

It also makes it very easy to port this to any other backend that `telegraf` can output to - just fork the container and modify the `telegraf` output script (which is generated via `etc/cont-init.d/02-telegraf` on container start).

## InfluxDB retention policies

By default, when Telegraf creates a database, it uses the default retention policy. At the time of writing, with InfluxDB version 1.8, this means the data is kept *indefinitely* (0 seconds).

```
InfluxDB shell version: 1.8.0
> use adsb
Using database adsb
> show retention policies
name    duration shardGroupDuration replicaN default
----    -------- ------------------ -------- -------
autogen 0s       168h0m0s           1        true
```

You should configure a retention policy to prevent your database from growing to consume all available disk space. Accordingly, you will need to modify the retention policy yourself. For example, if you wanted to keep the last 30 days of data:

```
InfluxDB shell version: 1.8.0
> CREATE RETENTION POLICY "30_days" ON "adsb" DURATION 30d REPLICATION 1 DEFAULT
> use adsb
Using database adsb
> show retention policies
name    duration shardGroupDuration replicaN default
----    -------- ------------------ -------- -------
autogen 0s       168h0m0s           1        false
30_days 720h0m0s 24h0m0s            1        true
```

## InfluxDB Measurement Schema

The following outlines the data schema, which should closely resemble the schema of `dump1090`/`readsb`'s `aircraft.json` file.

See <https://github.com/wiedehopf/readsb/blob/master/README-json.md#aircraftjson> for further information.

## Visualising the data

A very simple visualisation would be to create a table showing recent squawks:
